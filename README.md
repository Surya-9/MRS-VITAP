# MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM USING ML-VITAP
# 
We used a content filtering approach to recommend movies based on the attributes or characteristics of the movies themselves, rather than the preferences of other users. This approach may be less common compared to collaborative filtering or hybrid methods.
It uses the Porter stemmer as a natural language processing technique to stem the words in the 'tags' column. This may be a unique approach compared to other recommendation systems that use tokenization, stemming, or lemmatization.
It uses the TfidfVectorizer and cosine similarity from the scikit-learn library to compute the similarity between movies. The specific way in which these techniques are applied may be unique compared to other recommendation systems that use other machine learning techniques like K-nearest neighbors or matrix factorization.
We fetches poster images for the recommended movies using The Movie DB API, which may be a unique approach compared to other recommendation systems that use different APIs or do not use an API at all.
We delivered Streamlit to build the user interface for the app, which may be a unique approach compared to other recommendation systems that use different frameworks or technologies to build their interfaces.
